    "##### Vector\n",
    "A vector $\\bf v$ in $3-$spce $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is simply an ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ of real numbers. \n",
    "* We write ${\\bf v}=(a,b,c)$ and call the numbers $a, b$ and $c$ the components of the vector $\\bf v$.\n",

    "Let $\\bf u, v$ and $\\bf w$ be arbitrary vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and $a$ and $b$ scalars in $R$, then\n",
    "1. $\\bf u + v = v + u$ (Commutativity of addition)\n",
    "2. $\\bf u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$ (Associativity of addition)\n",
    "3. There exists an element $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, called the zero vector, such that $v + 0 = v$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",
    "4. For every ${\\bf v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists an element ${\\bf −v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, called the additive inverse of $\\bf v$, such that $\\bf v + (−v) = 0$.\n",
    "5. $a({\\bf u} + {\\bf v}) = a{\\bf u} + a{\\bf v}$.\n",
    "6. $(a + b){\\bf v} = a{\\bf v} + b{\\bf v}$.\n",
    "7. $a(b{\\bf v}) = (ab){\\bf v}$.\n",
    "8. $1({\\bf v}) = {\\bf v}$, where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",

    "#### Linear Independence in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",
    "The three vectors $\\bf u, v$, and $\\bf w \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ are said to __linearly dependent__ provided that one of them is a linear combination of the other two; that, either \n",

    "#### Basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$\n",
    "A __basis__ for $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a triple $\\bf u, v, w$ of vectors such that evey $t\\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ can be expressed as a linear combination\n",
